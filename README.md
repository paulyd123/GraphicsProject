Instructions:

This is a game where you must hit the bricks above you by using a paddle and a ball. If the ball goes below the paddle you lose, a pop up message appears saying you lost and the game then automatically restarts again after you click ok on the pop up box

I used websites that Ian McLoughlin had shown us, github and various other websites

I used websites such as:
https://robots.thoughtbot.com/pong-clone-in-javascript
http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Workflows/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Build_the_brick_field
https://github.com/
http://www.sitepoint.com/basic-animation-with-canvas-and-javascript/

I also asked class mates to help me

I would have liked to have been able to insert an up and down function where the paddle could muve up and down however I encountered too many problems trying this so I left it out.
